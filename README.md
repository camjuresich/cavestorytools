# cavestorytools
A collection of tools to make Cave Story modding changes relatively simple

## changesoundtrack.py

- This tool depends on Clownancy's Mod Loader and your install of Cave Story Deluxe being in the default location on windows. 
- You must have the soundtracks in the alternate_music directory in order soundtrack switching to work. 
- mod.txt (located in the mods directory) must have "alternate_music" written on one line for the mod to be enabled
